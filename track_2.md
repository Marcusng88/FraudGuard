## AI Agent Ecosystem

### 1. Unified Fraud Detection Agent

#### Core Intelligence Engine
- **Google Gemini Vision API:** Analyzes image content for plagiarism, fake metadata, suspicious patterns

#### Multi-Stage Analysis Pipeline
- **Image Analysis:** Content recognition, quality assessment, authenticity verification
- **Similarity Detection:** Vector embeddings comparison against existing NFT database
- **Metadata Validation:** Title, description consistency checks
- **LLM Decision Engine:** Final fraud determination with confidence scoring

#### Technical Implementation
- **Confidence Scoring:** 0-100 scale with automatic flagging at 80+ confidence
- **Flag Type Classification:** Plagiarism, fake metadata, price manipulation, wash trading, organized scams
- **Evidence Collection:** URLs, similarity scores, analysis details stored on-chain
- **Real-Time Processing:** Sub-30 second analysis for new NFT mints

### 2. Reputation Management System

#### Automated Reputation Engine
- **Starting Score:** 100 points for new users (trust-first approach)

#### Dynamic Scoring Algorithm
- **Fraud Detection:** -20 to -50 points (severity-based)
- **Legitimate Mints:** +5 to +10 points (quality-based)
- **Successful Sales:** +3 to +7 points
- **Community Validation:** +5 points for dismissed reports

#### Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Ban Threshold:** ≤30 points (automatic marketplace ban)
- **Review Threshold:** ≤50 points (increased AI monitoring)
- **Trusted User:** 90+ points (reduced friction, priority support)

#### Database Trigger Architecture
- **Atomic Updates:** Reputation changes processed via database triggers
- **Concurrent Safety:** Row-level locking prevents race conditions
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of reputation events with AI confidence scores

### 3. Blockchain Event Listener Agent

#### Real-Time Monitoring System
- **Event Detection:** Monitors Sui blockchain for NFT minting, trading, flagging events
- **Auto-Processing Pipeline:** New NFTs automatically queued for fraud analysis
- **State Synchronization:** Blockchain state mirrored in PostgreSQL for fast queries
- **Failure Recovery:** Event replay mechanism for system downtime scenarios
## Data Architecture & Storage

### Hybrid Storage Model

#### On-Chain Data (Sui Blockchain)
- NFT ownership and transfer history
- Fraud flags with confidence scores
- Marketplace listings and transaction records
- Reputation events for transparency

#### Off-Chain Data (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- NFT metadata and search indexes
- User profiles and ban management
- AI analysis details and evidence
- Vector embeddings for similarity detection

### Vector Similarity Engine

#### Embedding Generation
- **Google Gemini:** Generates 768-dimensional embeddings from image descriptions
- **pgvector Integration:** Enables sub-second similarity searches across millions of NFTs
- **Similarity Threshold:** 0.8+ cosine similarity triggers plagiarism alerts
- **Batch Processing:** Efficient embedding generation for large NFT collections

#### Search Performance
- **HNSW Indexing:** Hierarchical search for O(log n) similarity queries
- **Approximate Matching:** 95%+ accuracy with 10x speed improvement
- **Real-Time Updates:** New embeddings indexed immediately upon NFT creation

## End-to-End Technical Workflow

### NFT Creation & Fraud Detection Pipeline

#### User Uploads NFT
1. Frontend validates file format and metadata
2. Image uploaded to decentralized storage (Walrus/IPFS)
3. Backend initiates fraud analysis workflow

#### AI Fraud Analysis Execution
1. Gemini Vision analyzes image content and generates description
2. Description converted to 768-dimensional embedding vector
3. Vector similarity search against existing NFT database
4. Metadata quality analysis (title, description, pricing)
5. LLM-based final fraud determination with confidence scoring

#### Smart Contract Minting
- **If fraud score < 80:** Auto-mint to user's wallet
- **If fraud score ≥ 80:** Flag for manual review
- Blockchain event emitted triggering reputation update

#### Reputation Processing
1. Database trigger calculates reputation delta based on fraud analysis
2. User reputation score updated atomically
3. Ban check performed if score drops below threshold
4. Reputation event logged with AI confidence and evidence
### Marketplace Trading Architecture

#### Listing Process
1. User authorizes NFT transfer to marketplace escrow
2. Smart contract validates ownership and creates listing object
3. Listing metadata indexed for search and discovery
4. Real-time marketplace statistics updated

#### Purchase Execution
1. Buyer payment validated against listing price
2. Marketplace fee (2.5%) automatically deducted
3. NFT ownership transferred to buyer
4. Seller payment processed minus fees
5. Transaction recorded on-chain with event emission

#### Fraud Flag Handling
- AI agents can flag suspicious trading patterns
- High-confidence flags automatically trigger listing suspension
- Manual review queue for borderline cases
- False positive feedback loop improves AI accuracy

## Security & Trust Architecture

### Multi-Layer Fraud Prevention

#### Technical Safeguards
- Image hash verification prevents pixel-level manipulation
- Behavioral analysis detects wash trading patterns
- Price anomaly detection identifies manipulation attempts
- Community reporting with reputation-weighted voting

#### Economic Incentives

- False flagging penalties for malicious reports
- Marketplace fee structure funds ongoing fraud prevention
- Staking mechanisms for high-value transactions

### Privacy & Compliance

#### Data Protection
- User PII stored off-chain with encryption
- Blockchain data pseudonymous by design
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies
- Optional identity verification for premium features

#### Regulatory Readiness
- Comprehensive transaction logging for audit trails
- KYC/AML hooks for jurisdictional compliance
- Configurable fee structures for different markets
- Export functionality for regulatory reporting
